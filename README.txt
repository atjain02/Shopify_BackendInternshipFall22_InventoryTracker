This is the inventory tracking web application that I have built for the Fall 2022 Shopify Backend Developer Intern Challenge.

I used NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and EJS views.

I used these frameworks and MongoDB in particular to allow for efficient horizontal scaling in the future. For the purposes of saving time, since custom and reactive UI was not necessary, I did not use ReactJS or a CSS framework, but if needed that could have been implemented for a better quality front-end design.

I added the extra functionality of being able to create warehouses and assign items to warehouses.

The project can be viewed on replit where it is being hosted:

More information about the web-app and its functionality can be seen on the front page of the website.
